feat: enhance queue worker robustness and stream processing capabilities

## Summary
Comprehensive improvements to queue worker reliability, stream processing, and browser automation with enhanced error handling and timeout management.

## Key Changes

### Stream Processing Enhancements
- Enhanced stream response handling with sophisticated boundary detection algorithms
- Implemented silence detection for automatic completion detection
- Improved timeout management with dynamic TTFB calculations
- Added UI-based generation state checking with automatic fallback mechanisms
- Enhanced content transition detection between thinking and response phases

### Configuration & Settings
- Added thinking budget configuration controls (ENABLE_THINKING_BUDGET, DEFAULT_THINKING_BUDGET)
- Implemented Google Search tool integration (ENABLE_GOOGLE_SEARCH)
- Enhanced stream timeout state management with configurable thresholds
- Added DISABLE_THINKING_BUDGET_ON_STREAMING_DISABLE for independent streaming control

### Error Handling & Robustness
- Enhanced quota detection with global state management
- Improved browser automation error handling and recovery
- Added comprehensive DOM state validation and debugging tools
- Enhanced process cleanup and signal handling for graceful shutdowns
- Improved memory management with better resource cleanup

### Browser Operations
